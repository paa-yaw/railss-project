        <strong>RECITALS</strong><br>
          Spring operates an online platform at www.springgh.com (“the Website”) through which customers (“Users”) can book for the provision of cleaning services (“Cleaning Services”), by submitting a Booking Request. Spring then matches the most suitable Cleaner from its database to the Booking Request.
          The Cleaner is in the business of providing Cleaning Services.
					Spring does not offer Cleaning Services itself but is a third party facilitator of the contracts between the User and the Cleaner. Accordingly, Spring can receive and confirm Users’ requests for Cleaning Services, issue invoices on behalf of the Cleaners and pass on payments to the Cleaners.
					The User enters into two contractual relationships. The first contract being with Spring, governing the access to and use of the Website in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The second being with the Cleaners for the provision of Cleaning Services (“Cleaning Agreement”).

					In order to use this Website and make a Booking, you must first agree to the Terms.
					You accept the Terms by:
					creating a User Profile; and
					clicking to accept/agree to the Terms.
					Notwithstanding clause 3.2, you may not accept the Terms or access the Website if:

					<br>
					<br>

					<strong>User Profile</strong><br>
					You will be required to register your personal information, including your name, address, phone number and payment details on the Website in order to make a Booking (“User Profile”).
					You will be issued with a username and password which are linked to your User Profile. The username and password are personal to you and are not transferable. You are responsible for all information posted on or transmitted via the Booking System by anyone using your username and password and any payments due for the Cleaning Services acquired through the Booking System by anyone using your username and password. You should notify us of any breach of security of your username and password immediately.
					You must manage Bookings through the Spring platform; cancelling and rescheduling as and when needed.

					<br>
					<br>

					<strong>Booking System</strong><br>
					To make a Booking you must login to your User Profile and use the Booking System to request a Booking. You will receive a Booking request confirmation receipt from Spring after submitting your Booking request.
					Spring will then make your contact details, location, requested time and the scope of the Cleaning Service available to their Cleaner network. An available Cleaner will then be assigned to your request to confirm  their acceptance of the Booking.
					Currently you will be unable to select a preferred Cleaner.
					When a Booking is paired to a Cleaner, Spring will issue you with an acceptance email and attach the Cleaning Agreement that constitutes the relationship between you and the Cleaner for the provision of the Cleaning Services as well as a profile of the Cleaner. Spring will not, in anyway, be involved in the Cleaning Agreement between you and the Cleaner, aside from processing the Payment Amount on behalf of the Cleaner and providing you with an invoice in accordance with clause 6.4.
					If the requested Booking cannot be facilitated, Spring will arrange an alternative time for the Cleaning Service with you and a Cleaner.
					You are not permitted to engage the Cleaning Services of a Cleaner other than through the Booking System on the Website.

					<strong>Payment</strong><br>
					You agree that at the time of Booking, your payment details will be transferred to Spring’s secure payment gateway. Spring may check the availability of funds on your nominated payment method to ensure sufficient funds are available.
					Upon the successful completion of your Cleaning Service, you agree to the automatic debit of the Payment Amount to your nominated payment method. You must ensure that sufficient funds are available for debit at that time. Fees and charges relating to insufficient funds at time of debit will be passed onto you.
					On receipt of the Payment Amount, Spring will hold the Payment Amount on behalf of the Cleaner until such time as they are remitted to the Cleaner, refunded to you (if you are entitled to a refund) or transferred to Spring in payment of our fees and charges. No interest will be payable by Spring to you or the Cleaner on amounts held by Spring.
					Spring, in its name, will issue you with an invoice.
					Your payments to Spring are processed via an overseas gateway and from time to time, financial institutions or payment providers may charge an additional fee for transacting with Spring. If this occurs, the Customers bears that cost.

					<br>

					<strong>Changes and Cancellations</strong><br>
					You can cancel or amend a Booking on the Website, free of charge, up to 24 hours before the Cleaning Service is scheduled to begin.
